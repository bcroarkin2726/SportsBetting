# SportsBetting
I want to pull NFL betting odds from an API and use it to track how betting lines differ between different websites and across the week to view potential good betting opportunities.

An additional idea I have is to scrape all of the individual player bet odds from Bovada and compare them to fantasy projections for a player to find values.
